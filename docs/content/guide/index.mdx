Welcome to ðŸ—» Fuji.ts!

Fuji.ts is a fast, modern TypeScript utility collection. It contains simple yet robust utilities for everyday use, has zero dependencies, and is bundled to tree-shakable ES modules.

View it on GitHub: [VLTHellolin/fujits](https://github.com/VLTHellolin/fujits).

## Installation

### Node.js

You can install Fuji.ts on Node.js via NPM:

``` npm
npm i fujits
```

<Callout>

If you have a bundler, it's recommended to install `fujits` under `devDependencies` (i.e. `--save-dev`).

Since Fuji.ts provides tiny helper functions, doing so will improve performance becase you actually bundle Fuji.ts into your code. However, you can certainly keep `fujits` under your `dependencies`.

</Callout>

### Deno

You can install Fuji.ts on Deno via JSR:

``` shell
deno add @fujits/fujits
```

### CDN

Fuji.ts is only bundled in ESM format, so you can install it using the following method:

``` html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "fujits": "https://esm.sh/fujits@latest"
    }
  }
</script>
<script type="module">
  import { debounce } from 'fujits';
  // ...
</script>
```

## Prerequisites

Technically and hopefully speaking, Fuji.ts is compatible with the most of JavaScript environments, for it uses few modern JS features. However, we suggest you to check the prerequisites below to ensure Fuji.ts works properly:

- Browser:
  - Chrome `>=89`
