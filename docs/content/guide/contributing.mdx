Thank you for being so interested in our project! To contribute to this project, you will need to own a GitHub account and set up some necessary tools.

## Development

In order to make pull requests, you will have to fork [Fuji.ts](https://github.com/VLTHellolin/fujits).

After cloning the forked repo to your local machine, install the dependencies:

``` shell
pnpm install
```

To preview docs website:

``` shell
pnpm run --filter docs dev
```

To lint or run tests:

``` shell
pnpm lint # it will automatically lint files before `git commit`
pnpm test
```

## Contributing

Before writing code, you will have to know some principles of Fuji.ts.

### New Utility

You should choose an existing category to store your new utility, e.g. array, function.

After writing the source code, you should add a unit test file along with it. Vitest will test your new features on `pnpm test`.

Don't forget to export it in `index.ts` of the category:

``` ts
export * from './chunk';
export * from './shuffle';
// ...
```

### Comments

You should write detailed [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) comments for all exported utilities.
