## Bundle Fuji.ts into Your Code

If you use a bundler, it's recommended to bundle Fuji.ts into your code.

Doing so (especially in library projects, or app projects that use an external CDN) will reduce the pressure of resolving, boost tree-shaking, and eventually improve the performance.

In [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), make sure that the [`external`](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#external) dependencies don't contain Fuji.ts.

In most other bundlers, you can generally achieve it by adding Fuji.ts to `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`.
